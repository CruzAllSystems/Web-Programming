in general.<br>
Growing up I've always been interested in computers and video games, and have always
been great at using and understanding such concepts.<br>
This then carried over to high school, where I found my calling studying 
computer programming<br> <a href = \"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/\">
and eventually becoming most proficient in Java</a>. <br>
I hope to continue studying the field of computer science and understand as much <br>
as I can about technology as a whole.</p>";
