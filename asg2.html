<h1>Cruz Chavez (Graduation Class of 2020)</h1>
<h2><a href = "asg1.html">
See my pervious webpage here!</a></h2> 

<p>My interest in programming stems from a deep seeded interest in technology 
in general.<br>
Growing up I've always been interested in computers and video games, and have always
been great at using and understanding such concepts.<br>
This then carried over to high school, where I found my calling studying 
computer programming<br> <a href = "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/">
and eventually becoming most proficient in Java</a>. <br>
I hope to continue studying the field of computer science and understand as much <br>
as I can about technology as a whole.</p>
